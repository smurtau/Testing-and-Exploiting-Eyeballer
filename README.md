# Testing-and-Exploiting-Eyeballer

Eyeballer is a convolutional neural network based penetration 
testing tool that is designed to assist a tester in
narrowing the attack surface of a website. By identifying
certain specific types of web pages that may be more
susceptible to exploitation such as custom error pages,
login pages, old looking websites, webapps and parked
domains. Research has shown these types of web pages
introduce vulnerabilities at a much greater rate and so
the Eyeballer tool helps to identify them using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
There are also vulnerabilities within CNNs, 
such as the weakness of backpropagation. 
In this study, we attempt to use the Eyeballer tool to
test a large data set of screen shots of various web pages
in an effort to gauge itâ€™s precision and efficiency. We
also attempt to exploit some of the known weaknesses of
CNNs to force the Eyeballer tool to produce false negatives or false positive results.
